Display Fiat currency values in Bitcoin or visa-versa using real-time exchange rates.

== Description ==

Provides ability for content author to insert a shortcode specifying an amount in either Bitcoin or a Fiat currency.

The plugin then converts this value in to the corresponding value using real-time exchange rates.

For example, I use this on my business site to display my hourly rates in my local currency, as well as in Bitcoin.

Includes a Tiny MCE plugin to assist content author in generating the shortcode.

Requires PHP 7.0+ due to scalar argument declarations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are values updated client-side? =

At the moment no. All currency conversion is performed server-side. I'll probably add a jQuery plugin and optional data attributes in a later 
version to enable that functionality.


== Screenshots ==

1. Tiny MCE short-code generator plugin
2. Example public page showing real-time fiat to bitcoin conversion

== For Developers ==

You can modify the html output generated by the plugin using a standard WordPress filter.

`<?php  
add_filter('format_bitcoin_convert_output', 'my_custom_filter_function');
/**
 * Modify Bitcoin-Convert's HTML output
 * 
 * @param string[] $output
 * @var string $output['beforeSymbol']
 * @var string $output['afterSymbol']
 * @var string $output['beforeValue']
 * @var string $output['afterValue']
 * @var bool $output['prefixSymbol']
 * @var string $output['symbol']
 * @var float $output['value']
 * @return string[]
 */
function my_custom_filter_function(array $output){
    // Place your modification code here.
    return $output;
}
?>`
